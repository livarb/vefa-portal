## What is the address for Norwegian recipients?

The address for Norwegian recipients is "9908:[Organization number]" or "0192:[Organization number]" depending upon specification, where "[Organization number]" is the organization number assigned by [The Register of Business Enterprises](/ehf/open-data/the-register-of-business-enterprises/).

## May sub entities be used for addressing?

Sub entities, also known as ["Bedriftsnummer"](https://altinnett.brreg.no/no/Begreper-A-A/Bedriftsnummer/) may be registered in ELMA and used for addressing in EHF.
